Manage your default applications with ease using `handlr`! Now with the power of [regular expressions](#setting-regex-handlers)!

Fork of the original [handlr](https://github.com/chmln/handlr)

## Features

- Set default handler by extension or mime-type
- Set arbitrary commands as handlers based on regular expressions
- Intelligent mime type detection from files based on extension and content
- Open multiple files at once
- Set multiple handlers for mime/extension and use `rofi`/`dmenu` to pick one
- Wildcard support like `text/*`
- Automatically removes invalid/wrong `.desktop` entries from `mimeapps.list`
- Helper commands like `launch`, `get --json`, `mime --json` for your scripting needs
- Unnecessarily fast (written in Rust)
- Single compiled binary with no dependencies

## Usage

```sh
# Open a file/URL
handlr open ~/.dotfiles/pacman/packages.txt
handlr open https://google.ca

# Set default handler for png files
handlr set .png feh.desktop

# Set wildcard handler for all text files
handlr set 'text/*' nvim.desktop

# Set default handler based on mime
handlr set application/pdf evince.desktop

# List default apps
handlr list

# Get the handler for a mime/extension
$ handlr get .png
feh.desktop

# Launch a handler with given path/URL
handlr launch x-scheme-handler/https -- https://google.ca

# Get the mimetypes of given paths/URLs
handlr mime https://duckduckgo.com . README.md
```

## Compared to `xdg-utils`

- Can open multiple files/URLs at once
- Can have multiple handlers and use rofi/dmenu to pick one at runtime
- Far easier to use with simple commands like `get`, `set`, `list`
- Can operate on extensions, **no need to look up or remember mime types**
  - useful for common tasks like setting a handler for png/docx/etc files
- Superb autocomplete (currently fish, zsh and bash), including mimes, extensions, and `.desktop` files
- Optional json output for scripting
- Properly supports `Terminal=true` entries

## Setting default terminal 

Unfortunately, there isn't an XDG spec and thus a standardized way for `handlr` to get your default terminal emulator to run `Terminal=true` desktop entries. There was a proposal floating around a few years ago to use `x-scheme-handler/terminal` for this purpose. It seems to me the least worst option, compared to handling quirks of N+1 distros or using a handlr-specific config option. 

Now if `x-scheme-handler/terminal` is present, `handlr` will use it. 

Otherwise, `handlr` will:
1. Find an app with `TerminalEmulator` category
2. Set it as the default for `x-scheme-handler/terminal`
3. Send you a notification to let you know it guessed your terminal and provide instructions to change it if necessary

On the upside, `Terminal=true` entries will now work outside of interactive terminals, unlike `xdg-utils`.

### Terminal emulator compatibility
`handlr` should work with pretty much any terminal emulator.

However, some slight configuration may be necessary depending on what command line arguments your terminal emulator supports or required to directly run a command in it.

If it uses/supports `-e` (i.e. `xterm`, `xfce4-terminal`, `foot`, etc.) then you do not need to do anything.

If it requires something else, then set `term_exec_args` in `~/.config/handlr/handlr.toml` to the necessary arguments like so:

```
// Replace 'run' with whatever arguments you need 
term_exec_args = 'run'
```

If it does not require any arguments or if its arguments are already included in its .desktop file, but it does not use `-e`, (i.e. `wezterm`, `kitty`, etc.) set `term_exec_args` to `''`.

Feel free to open an issue or pull request if there's a better way to handle this.

## Setting multiple handlers

1) Open `~/.config/handlr/handlr.toml` and set `enable_selector = true`. Optionally, you can also tweak the `selector` to your selector command (using e.g. rofi or dmenu).

2) Add a second/third/whatever handler using `handlr add`, for example
```
handlr add x-scheme-handler/https firefox-developer-edition.desktop
```

3) Now in this example when you open a URL, you will be prompted to select the desired application.

## Setting regex handlers

Inspired by a similar feature in [mimeo](https://xyne.dev/projects/mimeo/)

Open `~/.config/handlr/handlr.toml` and add something like this:
```
[[handlers]]
exec = "freetube %u" # Uses desktop entry field codes
terminal = false # Set to true for terminal apps, false for GUI apps (optional; defaults to false)
regexes = ['(https://)?(www\.)?youtu(be\.com|\.be)/*.'] # Use single-quote literal strings
```

## Installation

### Arch Linux

```sh
paru -S handlr-regex-bin
```

Optionally you can also install `xdg-utils-handlr` to replace `xdg-open`:

```sh
paru -S xdg-utils-handlr
```

### Rust/Cargo

```sh
cargo install handlr-regex
```

### Binaries

1. Download the latest [release binary](https://github.com/Anomalocaridid/handlr/releases) and put it somewhere in `$PATH`
2. Download completions for fish:
```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anomalocaridid/handlr/master/completions/handlr.fish --create-dirs -o ~/.config/fish/completions/handlr.fish
```
